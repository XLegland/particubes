-- Hi!
-- 
-- This is a variant of the default script. It has been modified in order 
-- to allow "autofire" when maintaining the primary action button down.
-- This allow adding and removing cubes rapidly.
--
-- Lines that start with "--" are comments. 
-- Comments aren't considered when running the code,
-- it's a good thing to use them to leave notes for
-- yourself and other code contributors! :)

-- First thing to do in a game script: import some items!
-- (including the map)
-- Complete item names should be used: <repository>.<item>
-- Official items can be imported with just <item> (shortcut for official.<item>)
-- Imported items become available under Resources (or R shortcut):
-- Resources.<repository>.<item> (or R.<repository>.<item>)
Import (
    "aduermael.hills", -- item used as map
    "pen", 
    "pickaxe",
    "gdevillele.pan"
)

-- Events are objects that can be sent to other players, 
-- and/or to the Server.
-- There are pre-defined event types, documented here:
-- https://docs.particubes.com/reference/EventType
-- We can declare custom ones this way:
EventType.playerDied = EventType:New()

-- Set the map
-- (R is a shortcut for Shared.Resources)
Map.Set(R.aduermael.hills)

-- Note: All variables starting with an uppercase character
-- are exposed by the engine and are documented here:
-- https://docs.particubes.com
-- You can define your own variables, as long as the
-- name doens't start with an uppercase character.

-- Local.Player represents the local player.
-- Local.Player.Jump is nil (non existent) by default but we
-- can assign a function, defining how the players jumps
-- in the game. 
-- NOTE: players can jump differently based on the item
-- they're holding for example.
Local.Player.Jump = function (player)
    -- Test if player is on ground before changing velocity,
    -- otherwise, player could jump while in the air. :D
    if player.IsOnGround then
        player.Velocity.Y = Config.DefaultJumpStrength
    end
end

-- Local.Player can be used to store custom fields.
-- Let's use this to store the index of the item currently held by the player.
Local.Player.itemIndex = 1

-- List of items the player can hold
Local.items = {nil, R.pen, R.pickaxe, R.gdevillele.pan}

-- For now, colors can only be refered by their index in the default palette.
-- You can try different ones from 0 to 95.
-- A better system will be introduced soon.
Local.pinkColorIndex = 31

-- Fire rate for adding or removing cubes
-- ("Player" is a shortcut for "Local.Player")
Player.fireRate = 0.1 -- in seconds
Player.triggerOn = false
Player.firedOnce = false -- set to true when the auto-fire did fire at least once
Player.fireDT = 0.0

-- Define primary action function for the local Player
-- (left click on desktop, primary action button on mobile)
-- Note that "Player" is a shortcut for "Local.Player"
Player.PrimaryAction = function(player)
    Player.triggerOn = true
    Player.firedOnce = false
end

-- Player.PrimaryActionRelease can be defined and is triggered
-- when the primary action input gets released.
Player.PrimaryActionRelease = function(player)
    if Player.firedOnce == false then
        Local.fire()
    end
    Player.triggerOn = false
end

-- Define secondary action function
-- (right click on desktop, secondary action button on mobile)
Player.SecondaryAction = function(player) 
    player.itemIndex = player.itemIndex + 1
    if player.itemIndex > #Local.items then 
        player.itemIndex = 1 
    end
    player:Give(Local.items[player.itemIndex])
end

-- SecondaryActionRelease can be defined and is triggered
-- when the secondary action input gets released.
Player.SecondaryActionRelease = nil

-- Local.Tick is called continuously, 30 times per second.
-- In this sample script, we're using it to detect if the 
-- player is falling from the map.

        -- Local.Player.Say posts a message in the chat
        Player:Say('Nooooo! ðŸ˜µ')
